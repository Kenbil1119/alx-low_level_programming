# Bit Manipulation In C

Welcome to my directory: 0x14-bit_manipulation.
This directory contains C programs for bit manipulation.

## Files:

1. **0-binary_to_uint.c**
   - Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

2. **1-print_binary.c**
   - Function that prints the binary representation of a number.

3. **2-get_bit.c**
   - Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

4. **3-set_bit.c**
   - Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

5. **4-clear_bit.c**
   - Function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

6. **5-flip_bits.c**
   - Function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to convert one number to another.

## How to use:

1. Compile the C files using your preferred compiler.
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o your_executable_name
   ```

2. Run the executable.
   ```bash
   ./your_executable_name
   ```

Feel free to explore and use these functions for bit manipulation in your C programs!

Remember to replace "your_executable_name" with the actual name you choose for the compiled executable.
