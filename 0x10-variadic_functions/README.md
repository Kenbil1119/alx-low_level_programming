# Varaidic Function in C

Welcome to my directory!
# 0x10-variadic_functions

This directory contains C programs that showcase the use of variadic functions. Variadic functions are functions that accept a variable number of arguments.

## Files:

### 0-sum_them_all.c
A program that defines a function ```sum_them_all()``` to sum all its parameters.

### 1-print_numbers.c
This program contains a function ```print_numbers()``` that prints numbers, followed by a newline.

### 2-print_strings.c
A program with a function ```print_strings()``` that prints strings, followed by a newline.

### 3-print_all.c
A program that defines a function ```print_all()``` which prints anything, based on the format provided.

## Compilation and Execution:

To compile and execute these programs, follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal, and clone this directory with the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kenbil1119/alx-low_level_programming/0x10-variadic_functions.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing these files.
3. Use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 *.c -o variadic_functions
./variadic_functions
```

These commands will compile the C source files, assemble them, link them, and then execute the resulting programs.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of variadic functions in C.
