# Preprocessor, Compilation, Assembly and Linking In C Programming

Welcome! to my 0x0D-preprocessor directory.

This directory showcase preprocessing, compiling, assemblying, and linking in C program, which are the four basics of C program compilation.

Object-like Macros are put to use, as they contribute to the Compilation of C program at first level which showcase more about how Preprocessor works in C.

## Files:

### 0-object_like_macro.h
This file defines a simple object-like macro.

### 1-pi.h
Here, a header file is created that defines a macro named `PI` for the mathematical constant Ï€.

### 2-main.c
A C source file that includes the headers and demonstrates the use of the defined macros.

### 3-function_like_macro.h
Defines a function-like macro.

### 4-sum.h
Illustrates the use of function-like macros in performing addition.

## Compilation and Execution:

To compile and execute these files, follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Clone and navigate to the directory containing these files.
3. Use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -c *.c
gcc -o executable_name *.o
./executable_name
```

Replace `executable_name` with the desired name for the executable.

These commands will compile the C source files, assemble them, link them, and then execute the resulting program.

Feel free to clone, explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of the preprocessor and related concepts.
